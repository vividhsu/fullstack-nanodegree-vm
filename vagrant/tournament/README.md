# Project 1: Tournament Results

We write a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.
This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions) in tournament.sql, and writing code that will use it to track a Swiss tournament in tournament.py.
